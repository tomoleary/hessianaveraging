## Neural Operator training


These examples require the [`hippyflow`](https://github.com/hippylib/hippyflow) and [`hippylib`](https://github.com/hippylib/hippylib), which in turn require fenics 2019.1.0

I recommend creating a separate environment for the process of generating the training data.

### Installation

For more information see [the installation instructions with hippylib](https://github.com/hippylib/hippylib/blob/master/INSTALL.md). For example, in conda one can use:

	conda create -n fenics-2019.1 -c conda-forge fenics==2019.1.0 matplotlib scipy jupyter
